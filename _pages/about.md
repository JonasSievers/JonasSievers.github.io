I am a Ph.D. student at the Karlsruhe Institut of Technology (KIT) affiliated with the Institute for Data Processing and Electronics (IPE), with a primary focus on machine learning applications in energy systems. Throughout my research I explore different machine learning techniques, including federated learning, reinforcement learning, and time series forecasting, as they are increasingly important in the optimization of energy management systems.

`Federated learning` enables collaborative model training without sharing sensitive data, allowing various energy devices to work together enhancing data security, privacy, latency, and bandwidth efficiency within the underlying communication network.

`Reinforcement learning` enables energy management systems to make dynamic decisions through learning from interactions with the environment, leading to adaptive control strategies that optimize energy consumption, emissions, and operational costs.

`Time series forecasting`, driven by machine learning algorithms, utilizes historical energy data to make accurate predictions, helping energy managers plan and allocate resources more efficiently, while improving grid stability.
